      <h2>How to Reach Your Savings Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you're saving for a home, a car, or a vacation, understanding how much to save each month helps you stay on track. This calculator factors in interest earned on your savings.
      </p>

      <h3>Formula</h3>
      <p>
        PMT = FV Ã— (r / ((1 + r)^nt - 1))<br />
        <strong>Where:</strong><br />
        FV = future value (goal amount)<br />
        r = monthly interest rate<br />
        t = number of years<br />
        n = 12 (monthly contributions)
      </p>

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>
        To save $10,000 in 5 years at a 3% annual interest rate, you need to save approximately $152.15 per month.
