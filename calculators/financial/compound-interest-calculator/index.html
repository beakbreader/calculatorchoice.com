      <h2>What is Compound Interest?</h2>
      <p>
        Compound interest is the interest on a loan or deposit, calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. This means your investment grows faster over time.
      </p>

      <h3>Formula</h3>
      <p>
        A = P(1 + r/n)<sup>nt</sup><br />
        <strong>Where:</strong><br />
        P = principal amount<br />
        r = annual interest rate (decimal)<br />
        n = times compounded per year<br />
        t = number of years<br />
        A = amount after time
      </p>

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>
        Investing $1,000 at an annual rate of 5%, compounded monthly for 10 years, will grow to approximately $1,647.01.
