      <h2>Understanding Loan Repayments</h2>
      <p>When you take out a loan, it's essential to understand how your repayments are calculated. The monthly payment is determined based on the loan amount, the annual interest rate, and the loan term.</p>
      <h3>Formula:</h3>
      <p>
        Monthly Payment = [P x r x (1 + r)^n] / [(1 + r)^n â€“ 1]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>P</strong> = Loan amount</li>
        <li><strong>r</strong> = Monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12)</li>
        <li><strong>n</strong> = Total number of payments (loan term in months)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Using this formula helps you determine how much you'll pay each month, the total amount over the life of the loan, and the total interest paid.</p>
